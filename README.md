### Instructions
1. Just download the two files from the Github repository (hamdash.html and wheelzoom.js) and keep them together on the same folder.
2. Open hamdash.html with any browser of your preference and you done.
3. With any text editor (like Notepad) you can change the source images (can be more than one per box) or the menu options.

### Quick Help
* Double click on an image to expand to full screen.
* Double click again to close full screen view.
* Right click on an image to display the next one. (In the latest version is possible to add multiple images per box.)
* The content refreshes automatically every 5 minutes.

Is that easy!
